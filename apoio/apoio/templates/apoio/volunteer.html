<!-- What is a press release? -->

<div>

<h2>Glad you asked!</h2>

<p>A press release is a short statement by the Pirate Party (usually under 500 words) on a current issue that is provided to the media. Press releases usually respond to an event and promote the Pirate Party's position on that event (agreement or disagreement, and why).</p>

<p>When appropriate, press releases are used to announce candidates or new policies, and promote existing policies and campaigns.</p>

<p>Press releases are written in a similar style to news articles, but focus on the Pirate Party's position rather than reporting objective facts. Past press releases are available <a href='https://pirateparty.org.au/category/press-release/'>here</a>.</p>

</div>

<!-- I have an idea for a press release -->

<h2>Get into your fatigues, Mayo.</h2>

<p>Officers lead committees and teams or fulfil other specialist roles within the Pirate Party.</p>

<p>With the exception of the Policy Development Officer, all officers are appointed by the National Council for an indefinite period. The National Council does not ordinarily take applications for Officer positions unless it has formally announced a vacancy and invites applications.</p>
